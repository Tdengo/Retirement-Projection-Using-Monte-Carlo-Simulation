Traditional retirement calculators rely on static, normally distributed returns, which dangerously underestimate the impact of "Black Swan" market crashes and sequence-of-returns risk. This project utilizes a Monte Carlo decumulation engine to stress-test retirement portfolios against extreme macroeconomic conditions. Built entirely in Python and deployed via Streamlit, it allows users to accurately project portfolio survival probabilities using advanced statistical frameworks, including fat-tailed distributions and dynamic behavioral guardrails. This project involves the use of stochastic lifespans and copulas between volatility and the Student-t distribution, which provides a step up on free prediction models.
